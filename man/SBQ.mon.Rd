\title{Stacked backward CUSUM monitoring}
\usage{
SBQ.mon(formula, T, m = Inf, alternative = "two.sided", H = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Specification of the linear regression model by an object of the class "formula"}

\item{T}{Length of the training sample. Monitoring starts at T+1.}

\item{m}{The length of the relative monitoring period; default is m = Inf (infinite horizon monitoring).}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis; must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less".
The detector statistic is given by the maximum norm of \eqn{Q_t} ("two.sided"), maximum entry of \eqn{Q_t} ("greater"), or maximum entry of \eqn{-Q_t} ("less"), respectively.}

\item{H}{An optional matrix for the partial hypothesis \eqn{H'\beta_t = H'\beta_0}, where \eqn{H'Q_t} is considered instead of \eqn{Q_t}.
\eqn{H} must have orthonormal columns. The full structural break test is considered as the default setting (NULL).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\item{detector.scaled}{The vector containing the path of the sequential scaled stacked backward cusum detector from T+1 onwards}
\item{detector.array}{The matrix containing the triangular array of the stacked backward cusum detector}
\item{boundary}{The matrix containing the values of the triangular boundary surface}
\item{critical.value}{A vector containing critical values for different significance levels; NA if critical value for this specification is not implemented}
\item{rejection}{A logical vector containing the test decision for different significance levels; TRUE for rejection; NA if critical value is not implemented}
\item{detectontime}{The vector containing the detection time points for different significance levels, which are the time indices of the first boundary crossing; NA if the null hypothesis is not rejected}
\item{statistic}{The test statistic; maximum of the detector scaled by its boundary \eqn{d(r)}}
}
\description{
Performs the multivariate stacked backward CUSUM monitoring procedure using the linear boundary of Brown, Durbin, and Evans (1975)
